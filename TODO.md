- [ ] Lint everything:
  - [ ] Check indentation (especially HTML).
  - [ ] Check comments.
- [ ] Only restore data if none exists.
- [ ] Check again if Swagger documentation is correct (especially ID).

- [ ] Split last WIP commits into logical chunks.

# Done
- [x] Use the same `""` or `''` everywhere.
- [x] Create search bar.
- [x] Create list:
  - [x] Use MUI Data Grid for table.
- [x] Create fetch service.
- [x] Use CSS transitions for smoothness.
- [x] Change color and background of scrollbar (removed for Firefox).
- [x] Sort list by names.
- [x] Create buttons to change themes.
- [x] Introduce themes for different styles.
- [x] Change font-family of text-field (so caret is not positioned weirdly anymore).
  - [x] Cause: Helvetica.
  - [x] Add Roboto.
- [x] Use mixins in CSS or see how itâ€™s done with MUI.
- [x] See if I can eliminate redundancy in themes.
- [x] Use media queries for different screen sizes (use rem and/or em - to support Safari):
  - [x] Search bar and list must be resizable.
    - [x] Both must have the same size fluently in all different widths (>250).
    - [x] Take care of height also! Buttons are overlaying on small height.
    - [x] Use own breakpoints:
      - Overwriting existing ones led to resizing problems due to predefined max-width values for them, so I used my own.
  - [x] In mobile mode: either smaller text size or different organization (maybe only one column?).
- [x] Make scrollbar shorter in WebKit browsers! It overflows!
- [x] Filtering of names:
  - [x] Mark query pattern in results (bold).
- [x] Set rowID to actual ID, not to number.
- [x] Fix issues shown in inspect console (warnings are Firefox-related).
- [x] In `App.scss`, see what can be moved to MUI styling.
- [x] Fit result list always to size of results.
- [x] Catch error if backend is unavailable.
- [x] In `fetchService`: handle errors if backend/database returns error.
- [x] Load data into the database:
  - [x] Choose database.
  - [x] Add ID to data.
- [x] Define API.
- [x] Create Docker container for server.
- [x] Create Docker container for database.
- [x] Add date to logging.
- [x] Filtering of names:
  - [x] Only match from beginning! For first names and surnames.
  - [x] Don't care about capital letters.
