# Frontend
-[] media queries for different screen sizes (use rem and/or em - to support safari)        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  -[] search bar and list must be resizable
    -[] both must have same size fluently in all different width 
    -[] very difficult with realtive values. use more absolute values and therefore redefine xs, sm, lg etc 
    -[] take care of height also ! buttons are overlaying on small height 
  -[] in mobile mode: either smaller text size or different organization 
      (maybe only one column?)
